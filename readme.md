### Assumptions :link:
Website will be made using WordPress. Process will be incremental to simulate the industrial process. We would be given time every two weeks to converse with clients, our design would be for Osi-Can.
### Constraints :link:
Limited time to discuss with clients. We have to use WordPress, for better or for worse. We have to work with an existing brand rather than making our own.
